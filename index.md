  content: '<br>This project is both a historical research project and a pedagogical
    tool that can be used by researchers to create new connections between these materials.
    The exhibit was designed to provide researchers with multiple <strong>"ways in"</strong>
    to this material, depending on their learning preferences.<br><br>Researchers
    can comprehend the material <strong>geospatially</strong> through the <strong>Map</strong>,
    view <strong>chronologically</strong> and by <strong>subject</strong> tag through
    <strong>Browse</strong>, read every document <strong>visually</strong> or <strong>aurally</strong>
    through text to speech software on the <strong>Data</strong> page. Researchers
    can engage with oral history recordings as <strong>text</strong> or <strong>original
    audio recordings</strong> through <strong>Transcripts</strong> or <strong>visually</strong>,
    through the <strong>Subjects</strong> function.<br><br>Researchers can understand
    a large amount of text information very quickly through <strong>moving images</strong>
    in <strong>Text Mining</strong>, and gauge linguistic change over time. Finally,
    researchers can engage with the material <strong>interactively</strong> through
    the <strong>Network Visualization</strong>, where the entire collection is represented
    in a single frame and communities and associated industries can be highlighted
    and filtered to create future research.<br><br>The following gifs will show you
    the different ways that you can engage with this resource:'

  content: · This exhibit is centered around the <a href="https://aweymo.github.io/hnv_2/#"
    title="Historic Network Visualization">Historic Network Visualization</a> of the
    materials, containing newspapers, periodicals, archival collections and oral histories
    relating to 14 community groups from 1880-1930. The visualization allows the user
    to form connections based on community groups, industry or geolocation, and read
    a portion or complete transcript of the material within a single browser window.
    Each element within the visualization contains links to the digital object, which
    can be analyzed in greater detail or listened to in full, in the case of the oral
    history recordings.<br><br>· Using the CollectionBuilder Object Repository, researchers
    can explore the individual items utilized in this research, <a href="https://aweymo.github.io/CS.2/browse.html"
