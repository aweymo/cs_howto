  content: '<br>This project is both a historical research project and a pedagogical
    tool that can be used by researchers to form new connections within the material
    and create original work. The exhibit was designed to provide researchers with
    multiple <strong>"ways in"</strong> to this material, depending on their learning
    preferences.<br><br>Researchers can understand material <strong>geospatially</strong>
    through the <strong>Map</strong>, view <strong>chronologically</strong> and by
    <strong>subject</strong> tag through <strong>Browse</strong>, read every document
    <strong>visually</strong> or <strong>aurally</strong> through text to speech software
    on the <strong>Data</strong> page. Researchers can engage with oral history recordings
    as <strong>text</strong> or original <strong>audio</strong> recordings through
    <strong>Transcripts</strong> or <strong>visually</strong>, through the <strong>Subject</strong>s
    function.<br><br>Researchers can understand a large amount of text information
    very quickly through <strong>moving images</strong> in <strong>Text Mining</strong>,
    and gauge linguistic change <strong>over time</strong>. Finally, researchers can
    engage with the material <strong>interactively</strong> through the <strong>Network
    Visualization</strong>, where the entire collection is represented in a single
    frame and communities and associated industries can be<strong> highlighted</strong>
    and <strong>filtered</strong> to create future research.<br><br>The following
    gifs will show you the different ways that you can engage with this resource:'

  content: you can engage with how specific community groups were represented in media
    and contrast that linguistic change over time. The visualization that you see
    are the number of times particular words are repeated within the corpus, demonstrated
    by the size of each word's bubble. Hover over the bubble for the exact number
    and drag the bubbles around if you have trouble reading anything depending on
    how the visualization loads.

    in a single window. Full text of materials are included along with URLs for the
    item's full record, although you will need to copy paste into your browser as
    hyperlinking is unavailable for this tool. You may also search for titles within
    the attribute pane.
