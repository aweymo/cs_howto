  content: '<br>This project is both a historical research project and a pedagogical
    tool that can be used by researchers to create new connections between these materials.
    The exhibit was designed to provide researchers with multiple <strong>"ways in"</strong>
    to this material, depending on their learning preferences.<br><br>Researchers
    can comprehend the material <strong>geospatially</strong> through the <strong>Map</strong>,
    view <strong>chronologically</strong> and by <strong>subject</strong> tag through
    <strong>Browse</strong>, read every document <strong>visually</strong> or <strong>aurally</strong>
    through text to speech software on the <strong>Data</strong> page. Researchers
    can engage with oral history recordings as <strong>text</strong> or <strong>original
    audio recordings</strong> through <strong>Transcripts</strong> or <strong>visually</strong>,
    through the <strong>Subjects</strong> function.<br><br>Researchers can understand
    a large amount of text information very quickly through <strong>moving images</strong>
    in <strong>Text Mining</strong>, and gauge linguistic change over time. Finally,
    researchers can engage with the material <strong>interactively</strong> through
    the <strong>Network Visualization</strong>, where the entire collection is represented
    in a single frame and communities and associated industries can be highlighted
    and filtered to create future research.<br><br>The following gifs will show you
    the different ways that you can engage with this resource:'
